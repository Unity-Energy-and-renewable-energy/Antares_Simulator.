# Overview

_**Disclaimer: please note that the new Antares dynamic modeler is still under development, and that some of the 
features described in this section may still be unavailable**_

The new Antares dynamic modeler allows more flexibility in the definition of physical models used in the simulation. 
By doing so, it allows the users to conduct complex studies leveraging advanced physical models with highly 
customizable behavior.

All this is achieved by allowing the user to define the MIP variables and constraints behind every physical model
instantiated in their energy system.  
Of course, Antares is also delivered with a riche set of [standard models]() that can be used out-of-the-box, and that
can cover a large scope of everyday studies.
