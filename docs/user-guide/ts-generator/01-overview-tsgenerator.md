# Overview

_**This section is under construction**_

The Time-Series Generator tool is intended to be used before running an *Antares* simulation if you 
do not dispose of all the needed input data.  
This tool can be used to generate automatically [any or all](../solver/static-modeler/04-parameters.md) stochastic input data 
(such as renewable energy production time-series) 
and put them automatically inside the *Antares* [solver](../solver/static-modeler/02-inputs.md)'s input directory.
